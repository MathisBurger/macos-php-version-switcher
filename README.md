# Project information

The php version switcher is a cli application developed for
switching between php versions in a common macOS environment.
It is easy to use and does not require any dependencies!

# Installation

Download the latest artifact from the release and copy move it into
your `/usr/local/bin` folder. If you now restart your terminal, you can 
start using the software.

# Usage

There are two commands. `list` and `set`. Try them out yourself and check 
what they are doing

# Contribution

Is your OS not supported or your shell does not work? Feel free to open an issue
and I will start solving this issue for you with the next release.
